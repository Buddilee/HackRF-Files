## Collection of resources for HackRF
-----
All these files have been tested for functionality using the HackRF One combined with the Portapack H2 running the Mayhem firmware.

-----
## What should I do with this?
If you own a HackRF Portapack, you can upload these files to your device, giving you a collection of remote controls for various lighting systems, doorbells, cars, and more.

-----
## How to install?

1. Unpack the two archives located in the SAMPLES/REMOTE_OUTLETS folder.
2. Transfer the PLAYLIST and SAMPLES folders to the root directory of your Portapack's SD card, replacing any existing files.

## The repository is still under development.
At the moment, not all signals have been uploaded, but I am actively working on it. 
I strive to release one update each day. 
Thank you for your patience and support as I continue to enhance this repository for you.
